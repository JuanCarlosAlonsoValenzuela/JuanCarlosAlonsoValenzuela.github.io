abstract = {Testing web APIs automatically requires generating input data values such as addressess,
coordinates or country codes. Generating meaningful values for these types of parameters
randomly is rarely feasible, which means a major obstacle for current test case generation
approaches. In this paper, we present ARTE, the first semantic-based approach for
the Automated generation of Realistic TEst inputs for web APIs. Specifically, ARTE
leverages the specification of the API under test to search for meaningful test inputs
for the API parameters in knowledge bases like DBpedia. Our approach has been integrated
into RESTest, a state-of-the-art tool for API testing, achieving an unprecedented
level of automation which allows to generate up to 100% more valid API calls than
existing fuzzing techniques, 30% on average. Evaluation results on a set of 26 real-world
APIs show that ARTE can generate realistic inputs for 7 out of every 10 parameters,
outperforming related approaches.},
